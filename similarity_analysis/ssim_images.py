===========================
Structural similarity index
===========================

When comparing images, the mean squared error (MSE)--while simple to
implement--is not highly indicative of perceived similarity.  Structural
similarity aims to address this shortcoming by taking texture into account
[1]_, [2]_.

The example shows two modifications of the input image, each with the same MSE,
but with very different mean structural similarity indices.
